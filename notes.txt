- On background -> popup communication.

If we want to send a message to popup script from background script we call runtime.sendMessage. 
But the thing is that there is no popup frame active because the popup is not displayed by the moment runtime.sendMessage is called
Well, we could place the message delivery inside a listener on browserAction.onClicked event, 
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction/onClicked)
but beware that this event will not fire if the browser action has a popup.

Try adding this in background script:

setInterval(() => {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'directionxD' }, response => {
    console.log('Response from popup: ', response);
  });
}, 2000);

Add corresponding logic to popup script to listen for messages:

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  console.log('%cMessage from background: ', message);
  sendResponse({farewell: 'background <- popup '})
  return 
})

Now click on the action to show the popup view and pay attention to the console. 
Now the messages are recieved as long as the popup keeps opened.
